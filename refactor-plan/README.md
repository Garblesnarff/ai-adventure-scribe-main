# AI Dungeon Master Refactor Plan

This directory contains a **multi-phase, detailed plan** to refactor the entire codebase according to the coding standards in `CODE_STANDARDS.md`.

Each phase is documented in a separate markdown file for clarity and modular execution.

---

## **Phases**

1. [Phase 1: Directory Documentation](./phase-1-directory-docs.md)  
   Create README.md files for all key directories.

2. [Phase 2: File Naming Conventions](./phase-2-file-naming.md)  
   Rename all files to kebab-case and update imports.

3. [Phase 3: File Headers and Import Organization](./phase-3-file-headers-imports.md)  
   Add file headers and organize imports.

4. [Phase 4: Function Documentation](./phase-4-function-docs.md)  
   Add JSDoc comments to all functions and methods.

5. [Phase 5: Splitting Large Files and Functions](./phase-5-splitting-large-files.md)  
   Break up large files and long functions.

6. [Phase 6: Type Information and Segmentation](./phase-6-types-segmentation.md)  
   Add explicit types and segment code with comments.

7. [Phase 7: Implementation Notes and References](./phase-7-implementation-notes.md)  
   Add design notes and reference links.

8. [Phase 8: Testing and Validation](./phase-8-testing.md)  
   Run tests and add missing tests.

## **How to use this plan**

- Work through each phase **sequentially** or **incrementally**.
- After each phase, **commit changes** and run tests.
- Use this as a **living document** to track refactor progress.

## **Goal**

Achieve a **clean, maintainable, and LLM-optimized** codebase fully aligned with your standards.
