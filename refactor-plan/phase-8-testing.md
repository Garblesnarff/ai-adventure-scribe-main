# Phase 8: Testing and Validation

Run tests, add missing tests, and validate the refactored codebase.

---

## **Goals**

- Ensure the refactor **does not break existing functionality**
- Improve **test coverage** for critical modules
- Catch regressions early
- Build confidence in the refactored code

---

## **Steps**

### 1. Run Existing Tests

- Use your test runner (e.g., Jest, Vitest) to run all tests.
- Fix any failing tests immediately.

### 2. Add Missing Tests

- Identify **untested critical modules** (e.g., agents, services, hooks).
- Add **unit tests** for:
  - Core logic
  - Edge cases
  - Error handling
- Add **integration tests** for:
  - Agent workflows
  - API interactions
  - UI flows (if applicable)

### 3. Use Linting and Type Checks

- Run **linters** (e.g., ESLint) to catch style and potential bugs.
- Run **TypeScript** compiler (`tsc`) to catch type errors.

### 4. Manual Validation

- Manually test key user flows:
  - Campaign creation
  - Character creation
  - Gameplay interactions
- Verify UI components render correctly.

### 5. Automate

- Set up **CI pipelines** to run tests and checks on every commit.

---

## **Outcome**

A **robust, well-tested codebase** that is safe to extend and maintain after the refactor.
